      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>Please read these Terms very carefully. By using Linc or signing up for an account with Bitgenics you are agreeing to these Terms. This is a legal agreement. We’ll start with the basics, including a few definitions that should help you understand this agreement. Linc (“Linc" or the “Service”) is a Website &amp; web application hosting service offered through the URL bitgenics.io that allows you to upload, manage and host a Website or web application ("Website"). Linc is owned and operated by Bitgenics Pty Ltd, a company operating out Victoria, Australia ("Bitgenics", "we", or "us"). Bitgenics has employees, independent contractors, and representatives (“our Team”). As a customer of the Service or a representative of an entity that’s a customer of the Service, you’re a “Member” according to this agreement (or “you”).</p>

      <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms,” including our Privacy Policy, Acceptable Use Policy, API Guidelines, and Copyright Policy) define the terms and conditions under which you’re allowed to use Linc, and how we’ll treat your account while you’re a Member. If you have any questions about our terms, feel free to contact us.</p>

      <h2>Account</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Eligibility</h3>
          <p>In order to use Linc, you must:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>be at least eighteen (18) years old and able to enter into contracts;</li>
            <li>complete the registration process;</li>
            <li>agree to the Terms; and</li>
            <li>provide true, complete, and up to date contact information.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>By using Linc, you represent and warrant that you meet all the requirements listed above, and that you won’t use Linc in a way that violates any laws or regulations. (Representing and warranting is like making a legally enforceable promise.) Linc may refuse service, close accounts of any users, and change eligibility requirements at any time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Term</h3>
          <p>The Term begins when you sign up for Linc and continues as long as you use the Service. Signing up for an account with Linc through the Website, the Command Line Interface ("CLI") or the Application Programming Interface ("API"), means that you’ve officially “signed” the Terms. If you sign up for Linc on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to accept these Terms on their behalf.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Closing Your Account</h3>
          <p>You or Linc may terminate this Agreement at any time and for any reason by giving Notice to the other party. We may suspend our Service to you at any time, with or without cause. If we terminate your account without cause, we’ll refund a prorated portion of your monthly prepayment. We won’t refund or reimburse you if there’s cause, like a violation of these Terms or our Acceptable Use Policy. Once terminated, we may permanently delete your account and all the data associated with it, including any current and previous versions of your Websites.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Changes</h3>
          <p>We may change any of the Terms by posting revised Terms of Use on our Website and/or by sending an email to the last email address you gave us. Unless you terminate your account within ten (10) days, the new Terms will be effective immediately and apply to any continued or new use of Linc. We may change the Website, the Service, or any features of the Service at any time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Account and Password</h3>
          <p>You’re responsible for keeping your account name and password confidential. You’re also responsible for any account that you have access to, whether or not you authorized the use. You’ll immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your accounts. We’re not responsible for any losses due to stolen or hacked passwords. We don’t have access to your current password, and for security reasons, we may only reset your password.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Account Disputes</h3>
          <p>We don’t know the inner workings of your organization or the nature of your personal relationships, and we don’t arbitrate disputes over who owns an account. You won’t request access to or information about an account that’s not yours, and you’ll resolve any account-related disputes directly with the other party. We decide who owns an account based on the contact information in the account and/or the WHOIS information for any domains we host a Website on or access to that domain.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Payment</h2>
      <ol start="7">
        <li>
          <h3>Monthly Plans</h3>
          <p>Our charges for monthly plans are posted on our Website and may be changed from time to time. If any part of a month is included in the Term, then payment is due for the full month. Payments are due for any month on the same or closest date to the day you made your first monthly payment (the “Pay Date”). If you go over your hosting limits and reach another pricing level, then you’ll have to pay at the higher level on or before the next pay date. If the Term ends before that payment is due, you’ll still be required to make one payment at the higher level.</p><p>
        </p></li>
        <li>
          <h3>Credit Cards</h3>
          <p>As long as you’re a Member or have an outstanding balance with us, you’ll provide us with valid credit card information and authorize us to deduct the monthly charges against that credit card. You’ll replace the information for any credit card that expires with information for a valid one. Anyone using a credit card represents and warrants that they are authorized to use that credit card, and that any and all charges may be billed to that credit card and won’t be rejected. If we’re unable to process your credit card order, we’ll try to contact you by email and might suspend your account until your payment can be processed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Refunds</h3>
          <p>We’ll give you a refund for a prepaid month if we stop providing our Services to you for a reason that’s not laid out in these Terms or our Acceptable Use Policy. You won’t be entitled to a refund from us under any other circumstances. We may offer a refund if a Member applies for one based on the requirements posted on the Website.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Billing Changes</h3>
          <p>We may change our fees at any time by posting a new pricing structure to our Website and/or sending you a notification by email.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Rights</h2>
      <ol start="11">
        <li>
          <h3>Proprietary Rights Owned by Us</h3>
          <p>You will respect our proprietary rights in the Website and the software used to provide Linc (proprietary rights include patents, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, and copyrights). You may only use our brand assets according to our Brand Guidelines.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Proprietary Rights Owned by You</h3>
          <p>You represent and warrant that you either own or have permission to use all of the material in your Website. You retain ownership of the materials that you upload to the Service. We may use or disclose your materials only as described in these Terms and our Privacy Policy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
          <p>We may only use and disclose your information according to our Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy will be treated as part of these Terms.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Right to Review Websites</h3>
          <p>We may view, copy, and internally distribute content from your Website and account to create algorithms and programs (“Tools”) that help us spot problem accounts. We use these Tools for example to find Members who violate these Terms or laws, but we also study data internally to make your Website experience smarter and create better experiences for you and your customers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Free and/or Open Source Alternative</h3>
          <p>We hate vendor lock-in as much as ivory tower architects. We want you to choose and keep using Linc because it is the best platform to host a Website on. So we will make available either a free and/or open source platform you can use to self-host if you so desire.</p>

          <p>This version won't have feature parity with the full Linc suite, but it will allow you to host a single version of your Website on your own servers.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Bandwidth Abuse/Throttling</h3>

        <li>
          <h3>Severability</h3>
          <p>If it turns out that a section of this Agreement isn’t enforceable, then that section will be removed or edited as little as necessary, and the rest of the Terms will still be valid.</p>
